## 1. Machine Learning (ML)
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data where the algorithm is trained on input-output pairs.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning from unlabeled data to discover patterns and relationships without explicit guidance.
- **Semi-supervised Learning**: Combining labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
##  2. Deep Learning
- Deep learning (DL) is a powerful and popular subfield of machine learning (ML) inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
- Utilizes **artificial neural networks (ANNs)**, interconnected layers of processing units mimicking biological neurons.
- Trains on large amounts of data to learn complex patterns and relationships, enabling remarkable performance in various tasks.
## 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating field within artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with machines understanding and manipulating human language.
- It aims to enable computers to understand, generate, and manipulate human language in its various forms (text, speech, etc.).
- Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
## 4. Computer Vision
- Computer vision is a fascinating field of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with enabling computers to "see" and understand the world around them. 
- It involves extracting meaningful information from images and videos, similar to how humans do, and leveraging it for various purposes.
- **Image Classification**: Assigning labels or categories to images based on their content.
- **Facial Recognition**: Identifying and verifying individuals based on facial features.
