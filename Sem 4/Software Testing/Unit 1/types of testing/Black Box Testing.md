## Functional Testing 
This type of testing verifies that the software functions correctly according to specified requirements. It focuses on what the software does, not how it achieves the functionality. 
This is further divided into three parts:
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components or modules to ensure they operate as intended.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between different modules or subsystems.
- **System Testing**: Testing the entire system to validate end-to-end functionality.

## Non-Functional Testing 
Non-functional testing evaluates aspects of the software beyond its functionality. It includes:
- **Performance Testing**: Assessing the software's responsiveness, scalability, and resource usage under various conditions.
- **Usability Testing**: Evaluating the software's user interface, ease of use, and user experience.
- **Compatibility Testing**: Testing the software's compatibility with different environments, platforms, and devices.
- **Security Testing**: Assessing the software's resistance to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.
