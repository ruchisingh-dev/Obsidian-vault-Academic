## Definition
- Manual testing involves executing test cases and scenarios manually by human testers without the use of automated tools or scripts.
- Testers interact directly with the software application, inputting data, and observing outputs to verify its behavior.

## Types of Manual Testing 
### Black box Testing 
- **Definition**: Black box testing is a testing technique where the tester does not have access to the internal code or structure of the software being tested.
- **Approach**: Testers interact with the software through its user interface and inputs, focusing on validating outputs against expected results.
- **Example**: Imagine a tester using a website without knowing how the code behind it works. They input data, click buttons, and observe the responses without knowledge of the internal workings.

### White Box Testing
- **Definition**: White box testing, also known as clear box or structural testing, involves testing the internal structure and logic of the software application.
- **Approach**: Testers have access to the source code and design of the software, allowing them to design test cases based on internal logic, code paths, and control flows.
- **Example**: Testers review the codebase and design tests to exercise specific code paths, branches, and conditions within the software.
### Gray Box Testing 
- **Definition**: Grey box testing is a combination of black box and white box testing techniques, where testers have partial knowledge of the internal workings of the software.
- **Approach**: Testers have limited access to internal structures, such as database schemas, architectural diagrams, or interface specifications, allowing them to design tests that explore both internal logic and user-facing functionality.
- **Example**: Testers may have access to some parts of the codebase or system architecture while testing certain modules or components as black box entities.
